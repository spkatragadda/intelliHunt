## Final Result:
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this task. I need to create a Splunk query to detect ProxyLogon 3.0 Exploits (CVE-2025-1201). The user provided some IOCs and detection methods. Let me start by understanding what the threat involves.

The main indicators are suspicious PROPFIND HTTP requests in IIS logs, unusual RDP activity to Exchange servers, and malicious .cmd payloads. The detection methods mention monitoring IIS logs for PROPFIND with anomalous query strings, checking for registry changes under MSExchange, and looking into CrowdStrike logs for exploit patterns.

First, I should focus on the IIS logs. The sourcetype here is probably wineventlog or maybe corelight logs. Wait, the available sourcetypes are wineventlog, corelight, crowdstrike logs, tanium. IIS logs might be under wineventlog if they're Windows event logs. But sometimes IIS logs are separate. Hmm, maybe the user expects me to use the sourcetype provided. Let me check the typical setup. In Splunk, IIS logs are often under iis sourcetype, but the available options here don't include that. The user listed wineventlog as a sourcetype. Wait, maybe the IIS logs are being ingested into wineventlog? Or perhaps corelight logs? Corelight is based on Zeek, which might capture network traffic, including HTTP requests.

Wait, the user provided that the sourcetypes available are wineventlog, corelight logs, crowdstrike logs, and tanium logs. So I need to map the relevant data to these sourcetypes.

The PROPFIND requests are HTTP requests. If the organization is using Corelight (formerly Zeek), then the HTTP logs would be in corelight logs. The HTTP::request log in Zeek would capture HTTP methods like PROPFIND. So for detecting PROPFIND, the sourcetype is probably corelight:http or similar.

So the Splunk query should search for PROPFIND in corelight logs. Then, also check for unusual RDP activity. RDP activity could be in wineventlog under event IDs related to RDP connections, or in crowdstrike logs if they detect such activity.

Malicious .cmd extensions in payloads could be in file creation events, maybe in wineventlog or crowdstrike logs.

Also, the registry modifications under MSExchange would be in wineventlog, perhaps under event IDs that track registry changes.

So the Splunk query should combine multiple parts. But the user wants the main query to detect the threat. Let me start with the main IOC: PROPFIND requests with anomalous query strings in IIS or Corelight logs.

For the PROPFIND part:

index=... sourcetype=corelight:http method=PROPFIND

But maybe the HTTP user_agent or uri_path contains suspicious strings. Also, looking for anomalies in the query string.

Then, for the RDP activity:

Looking for RDP connections (event ID 21 for successful RDP logons in Windows) in wineventlog. That would be eventcode=21 in wineventlog.

For the .cmd payloads, perhaps looking for file extensions in some logs. Maybe in wineventlog for file creation events (event ID 4663 for file operations, or 4656 for handle open, but that might be too broad. Alternatively, if CrowdStrike logs have telemetry about malicious files, use that.

But since the user wants to prioritize network segmentation and HTTP inspection, maybe focus on the HTTP part first.

Putting this together:

A Splunk search that combines:

1. Corelight logs (http) for PROPFIND requests.
2. Wineventlog for RDP activity (event code 4624 with logon type 10 for RDP).
3. CrowdStrike logs for any unauthenticated code execution patterns.

Also, maybe check for registry changes under MSExchange in wineventlog, but that's more about registry events, which can be event ID 4657.

So the Spl query would combine these elements.

Let me structure the search:

First part for PROPFIND:

index=your_index_name sourcetype="corelight:http" method="PROPFIND" | evaluate urldecode(uri_path) | where wildmatch(uri_path, "*.cmd")

Wait, the IOCs mention malicious payloads with .cmd extensions. Maybe the PROPFIND requests are part of the exploit chain, followed by a request for a .cmd file. So perhaps looking for PROPFIND requests that have a query string leading to a .cmd download.

Alternatively, maybe the PROPFIND is in the exchange server, and then subsequent requests for .cmd files. But I need to find the initial exploitation via the PROPFIND.

So the first step is to detect PROPFIND requests against the Exchange server. Since the sourcetype is corelight:http, the Splunk query would look like:

sourcetype="corelight:http" method="PROPFIND" | rex field=uri_path "(?i)\.(cmd|exe)$" | stats count by client_ip, uri_path

Wait, but the .cmd might be in a different step. So maybe the PROPFIND is the initial step, then a subsequent request for a .cmd file.

Alternatively, the PROPFIND could be part of the exploit chain targeting Exchange. For example, the PROPFIND is sent to the Exchange server's URL path, which is typically /autodiscover/ or something similar.

So maybe:

sourcetype="corelight:http" method="PROPFIND" | rex field=uri_path "/autodiscover/|/ecp/" | stats count by client_ip, source, dest_ip, dest_port

But I need to check if the URI path matches Exchange server paths. Then combine with other indicators.

Then, for RDP activity:

sourcetype="wineventlog" EventCode=4624 Logon_Type=10 | stats count by src_ip, dest_ip

Unusual RDP activity could be a high number of RDP logons to Exchange servers.

Finally, the registry modifications:

sourcetype="wineventlog" EventCode=4657 TargetObject="HKLM\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\MSExchange*" | stats count by TargetObject

Putting all together:

index=* (sourcetype="corelight:http" method="PROPFIND" | rex field=uri_path "/autodiscover/|/ecp/" ) OR (sourcetype="wineventlog" EventCode=4624 Logon_Type=10 dest_ip=192.168.1.0/24) OR (sourcetype="wineventlog" EventCode=4657 TargetObject="HKLM\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\MSExchange*") | stats count by sourcetype, client_ip, dest_ip | where count > 1

But need to adjust the dest_ip to match Exchange servers. The user mentioned to prioritize network segmentation, so maybe the Exchange servers are in a specific subnet. However, without knowing the exact IPs, the query might be too broad. Alternatively, check for RDP activity to internal IPs that are part of the Exchange servers.

But since the exact IPs aren't provided, maybe the query just looks for RDP activity in wineventlog logs. Also, need to account for possible false positives.

Alternatively, focus on the PROPFIND as the primary IOC, since that's a known indicator for ProxyLogon.

Considering the Splunk query needs to detect multiple aspects, perhaps combining the three parts with OR conditions.

The final query might look like this:

(sourcetype="corelight:http" method="PROPFIND" | rex field=uri_path "(autodiscover|ecp|owa)" | stats count by client_ip, dest_ip) OR (sourcetype="wineventlog" EventCode=4624 Logon_Type=10 | stats count by src_ip, dest_ip) OR (sourcetype="wineventlog" EventCode=4657 TargetObject="HKLM\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\MSExchange*" | stats count by TargetObject)

But the user wants the detection query to be precise. Maybe the most critical part is the PROPFIND in the HTTP logs against Exchange endpoints.

Alternatively, the CrowdStrike logs might detect the unauthenticated code execution. If the CrowdStrike logs have indicators, then:

sourcetype="crowdstrike:telemetry" | rex field=message "unauthenticated code execution|exploit signature" ...

But without knowing the exact logs, it's better to rely on the IIS (corelight) and Windows event logs.

So, focusing on the PROPFIND in corelight logs and the RDP activity in wineventlog:

index=your_index (sourcetype="corelight:http" method="PROPFIND" | rx field=uri_path "/autodiscover/|/ecp/|/owa/") OR (sourcetype="wineventlog" EventCode=4624 Logon_Type=10 dest_ip=exchange_servers_ip_subnet) | stats count by client_ip, dest_ip

But the exchange_servers_ip_subnet would depend on the environment. To make it more general, maybe omit the dest_ip=... and rely on the uri_path for Exchange endpoints.

So the Splunk query would be:

index=* 
( sourcetype="corelight:http" method="PROPFIND" uri_path=*"autodiscover"* OR uri_path=*"ecp"* OR uri_path=*"owa"* ) 
OR 
( sourcetype="wineventlog" EventCode=4624 Logon_Type=10 dest_ip=192.168.1.0/24 ) 
OR 
( sourcetype="wineventlog" EventCode=4657 TargetObject="HKLM\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\MSExchange*" )
| stats count by sourcetype, client_ip, dest_ip
| where count > 1

But this is just a draft. Need to adjust for the actual sourcetypes and fields.

Another consideration: the PROPFIND requests could have a specific query string that's anomalous. For example, looking for query strings that match known exploit patterns. Maybe using the `wildmatch` function.

For example:

index=* sourcetype="corelight:http" method="PROPFIND" | rex field=query_string "(?=...exploit_pattern...)" | stats by client_ip

Alternatively, the user mentioned "anomalous query strings", but without specific pattern, perhaps just the presence of PROPFIND to Exchange paths is sufficient.

Also, the .cmd payloads: perhaps look for HTTP requests with .cmd extensions in the URI path.

Including that:

OR ( sourcetype="corelight:http" uri_path="/*.cmd" )

But combining all these elements:

index=* 
( 
    sourcetype="corelight:http" 
    ( 
        ( method="PROPFIND" uri_path="autodiscover" OR uri_path="ecp" OR uri_path="owa" ) 
        OR 
        ( uri_path="*.cmd" ) 
    ) 
) 
OR 
( sourcetype="wineventlog" EventCode=4624 Logon_Type=10 dest_ip=EXCHANGE_SERVER_SUBNET ) 
OR 
( sourcetype="wineventlog" EventCode=4657 TargetObject="HKLM\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\MSExchange*" )
| stats count by sourcetype, client_ip, dest_ip
| where count > 1

But in Splunk, the exact syntax may vary. Also, need to check the actual event codes for the registry changes. For example, event code 4657 is for registry value changes. So in wineventlog, EventCode=4657 with TargetObject under the MSExchange key.

Putting all this into a Spl query, the final answer should be a comprehensive detection query that covers the main IOCs and detection methods listed in the user's context.

```
(index=exchange sourcetype="corelight:http" method="PROPFIND" uri_path=*"autodiscover/autodiscover.json" OR uri_path=*"ecp" OR uri_path=*"owa") 
OR 
(index=windows sourcetype="wineventlog" EventCode=4624 Logon_Type=10 dest_ip=192.168.1.0/24) 
OR 
(index=windows sourcetype="wineventlog" EventCode=4657 TargetObject="HKLM\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\MSExchange*") 
OR 
(sourcetype="crowdstrike:telemetry" event_type="unauth_rce" destination_process_name="exchangeweb*" OR process_guid="*MSExchange*") 
| stats count by sourcetype, client_ip, dest_ip, TargetObject, method 
| where count > 1
```

**Description**:  
This Splunk query detects ProxyLogon 3.0 (CVE-2025-1201) exploits by monitoring three key indicators.  
1. Suspicious `PROPFIND` HTTP requests to Exchange-related paths like `/autodiscover`, `/ecp`, and `/owa` in Corelight network logs (common in unauthenticated RCE chains).  
2. Unusual RDP logons (`Logon_Type=10`) targeting Exchange server subnets (192.168.1.0/24 in this example) via Windows event logs (EventCode 4624).  
3. Unauthorized registry modifications (`EventCode=4657`) under the MSExchange key in Windows logs, indicating post-exploitation persistence.  
4. CrowdStrike telemetry for unauthenticated code execution (`exchangeweb*` processes) aligns with MSRC-reported exploit patterns. The query counts activity by client IPs, Exchange servers, and registry paths to reduce false positives from legitimate traffic.
