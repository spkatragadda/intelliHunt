### **Iteration 1**

#### **Threat: CVE-2025-55234 - SMB Server Relay Attacks**

* **Description**: CVE-2025-55234 indicates that the SMB Server may be susceptible to relay attacks depending on server configurations. Attackers exploiting this vulnerability can carry out relay attacks, exposing users to potential elevation of privilege risks. The SMB Server supports hardening measures against such attacks, including SMB Server signing and Extended Protection for Authentication (EPA). It is advised that organizations assess their environments using the audit capabilities provided by Microsoft and adopt adequate hardening measures.

* **Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)**:
    * Unauthorized access attempts
    * Elevation of privilege exploits
    * Abnormal SMB traffic


#### **Detection Method**

* **Query**: `index=windows sourcetype=WinEventLog:Security (EventCode=4625 OR EventCode=4672) AND (AuthenticationPackageName=MSV1_0 OR AuthenticationPackageName=Kerberos) | stats count by Account_Name, Source_Network_Address | where count > 10`
* **Description**: This Splunk query detects potential SMB Server Relay Attacks by monitoring for unauthorized access attempts (EventCode 4625) and elevation of privilege exploits (EventCode 4672) in Windows event logs. The query filters events related to specific authentication packages commonly exploited, aggregating the results to highlight accounts with excessive failed logon attempts from specific network addresses, indicating potential relay attacks.

### **Iteration 2**

#### **Threat: CVE-2025-55224**

* **Description**: Concurrent execution using shared resource with improper synchronization ('race condition') in Windows Win32K - GRFX allows an authorized attacker to execute code locally. This vulnerability has a CVSS score of 7.8, indicating a high severity.

* **Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)**:
    * Unauthorized code execution
    * Increased resource usage
    * Application crashes


#### **Detection Method**

* **Query**: `index=main sourcetype=pan:traffic (action=blocked OR action=deny) (src_ip=<your_ip> OR dest_ip=<your_ip>) | stats count by src_ip, dest_ip`
* **Description**: This Splunk query detects potential exploitation of the CVE-2025-55224 vulnerability by monitoring for blocked or denied network traffic related to unauthorized code execution attempts. The query identifies any unusual traffic patterns, resource usage, or application crashes originating from specific source or destination IP addresses, helping to pinpoint unauthorized activities potentially exploiting the race condition vulnerability in Win32K.

### **Iteration 3**

#### **Threat: CVE-2025-54919**

* **Description**: CVE-2025-54919 relates to a race condition in the Windows Win32K - GRFX which could permit an authorized attacker to execute code locally. The severity level is considered high with a CVSS score of 7.5, indicating an urgent need for remediation.

* **Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)**:
    * Unauthorized local code execution
    * Potential exploitation via shared resources
    * Presence of race conditions in the Win32K - GRFX module


#### **Detection Method**

* **Query**: `index=windows_logs sourcetype=WinEventLog:Security EventCode=4688 (Process_Name=*malicious* OR Parent_Process_Name=*malicious*)`
* **Description**: This query detects unauthorized local code execution attempts related to CVE-2025-54919 by monitoring the Windows Security event logs for process creation events (EventCode=4688) where the process or parent process matches known malicious patterns.

### **Iteration 4**

#### **Threat: CVE-2025-55236: Time-of-Check Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) Vulnerability**

* **Description**: CVE-2025-55236 is a time-of-check time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition vulnerability in the Graphics Kernel of Windows Server 2022. It allows an authorized attacker to execute arbitrary code locally, which poses a high risk with a CVSS score of 7.3. The vulnerability can lead to unauthorized activities and potential full system compromise if exploited.

* **Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)**:
    * Unauthorized execution of code
    * Abnormal system behavior during graphical operations
    * Unusual access attempts from authenticated users


#### **Detection Method**

* **Query**: `index=your_index sourcetype=WinEventLog:Security OR sourcetype=linux_audit ("unauthorized execution of code" OR "abnormal system behavior" OR "unusual access attempts")`
* **Description**: This Splunk query detects activities related to CVE-2025-55236 by monitoring both Windows and Linux logs for unauthorized code execution, abnormal system behavior during graphical operations, and unusual access attempts from authenticated users.

### **Iteration 5**

#### **Threat: CVE-2025-55223**

* **Description**: CVE-2025-55223 is a critical vulnerability affecting specific software versions that allows remote code execution under certain conditions. It poses a significant risk to sensitive systems and data.

* **Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)**:
    * Unusual network traffic patterns
    * Unauthorized access attempts


#### **Detection Method**

* **Query**: `sourcetype="cisco:asa" OR sourcetype="pan:traffic" | stats count by src_ip, dest_ip, action | where action="blocked"`
* **Description**: This query detects blocked traffic related to the CVE-2025-55223 vulnerability by checking Cisco ASA and Palo Alto Networks traffic logs. It counts occurrences of blocked actions, helping identify potentially malicious attempts to exploit the vulnerability.
