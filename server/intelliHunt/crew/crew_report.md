### **Iteration 1**

#### **Threat: CVE-2025-26515: StorageGRID Server-Side Request Forgery Vulnerability**

* **Description**: StorageGRID (formerly StorageGRID Webscale) versions prior to 11.8.0.15 and 11.9.0.8 without Single Sign-on enabled are susceptible to a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability. Successful exploit could allow an unauthenticated attacker to change the password of any Grid Manager or Tenant Manager non-federated user.

* **Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)**:
    * Unexpected password changes logs
    * Unauthorized user management activities


#### **Detection Method**

* **Query**: `Detection of unauthorized password change attempts targeting StorageGRID systems.`
* **Description**: This detection method aims to identify unauthorized password changes in StorageGRID systems that are susceptible to the CVE-2025-26515 vulnerability. The detection logic focuses on monitoring security logs for unusual patterns indicating exploitation attempts, highlighting both behavioral indicators and specific indicators of compromise.

### **Iteration 2**

#### **Threat: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting in StorageGRID**

* **Description**: StorageGRID (formerly StorageGRID Webscale) versions prior to 11.8.0.15 and 11.9.0.8 are susceptible to a Reflected Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability. Successful exploit could allow an attacker to view or modify configuration settings or add or modify user accounts but requires the attacker to know specific information about the target instance and then trick a privileged user into clicking a specially crafted link.

* **Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)**:
    * Clicked malicious link
    * Unusual changes in configuration settings


#### **Detection Method**

* **Query**: `Detect Reflected XSS in StorageGRID environments`
* **Description**: This detection method identifies potential reflected Cross-Site Scripting attacks on StorageGRID systems by monitoring user clicks on external links and subsequent configuration changes.

### **Iteration 3**

#### **Threat: Privilege Escalation in StorageGRID**

* **Description**: StorageGRID (formerly StorageGRID Webscale) versions prior to 11.8.0.15 and 11.9.0.8 are susceptible to a privilege escalation vulnerability. Successful exploit could allow an unauthorized authenticated attacker to discover Grid node names and IP addresses or modify Storage Grades.

* **Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)**:


#### **Detection Method**

* **Query**: `Monitor Windows and Linux Logs for Privilege Escalation Indicators`
* **Description**: This detection method utilizes Windows Security Event logs and Linux authentication logs to identify unauthorized privilege escalation attempts on the StorageGRID infrastructure. It focuses on identifying events related to account privilege changes, suspicious logon types, and process creations that align with the tactic of privilege escalation.

### **Iteration 4**

#### **Threat: CVE-2025-26516**

* **Description**: StorageGRID (formerly StorageGRID Webscale) versions prior to 11.8.0.15 and 11.9.0.8 are susceptible to a Denial of Service vulnerability. Successful exploit could allow an unauthenticated attacker to cause a Denial of Service on the Admin node.

* **Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)**:


#### **Detection Method**

* **Query**: `Detection of Denial of Service vulnerability exploitation attempts targeting StorageGRID Admin Node`
* **Description**: This detection method aims to identify potential exploitation attempts for CVE-2025-26516 by monitoring network traffic and authentication logs for unusual patterns indicating unauthorized access or Denial of Service conditions targeting the StorageGRID Admin Node.
