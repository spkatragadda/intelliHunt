Action: Web Scraper
Input: {"url": "https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2025-55236"}

Observation: 
- The MSRC page confirms CVE-2025-55236 is a Time-of-check time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition in the Graphics Kernel that could allow an authorized attacker to execute code locally.
- CVSS score is 7.3 (HIGH).
- Affected product listed: cpe:2.3:o:microsoft:windows_server_2019:10.0.17763.2114:*:*:*:standard:*:x64:*.
- The vulnerability is referenced as a vendor advisory with the MSRC page providing the vulnerability summary, impact, affected products, and remediation guidance.
- Mitigation guidance on the MSRC page emphasizes applying the latest security updates/patches via Windows Update or Microsoft Update Catalog.

Note: The MSRC page itself is the primary reference for this vulnerability, including the official vulnerability description, impact, affected products, and remediation steps.

Thought: I will now compile the threat report with the MSRC detail and include at least one formal media coverage entry, focusing on credible sources that reported on this vulnerability in the last few days.

Action: Google Search
Input: {"query": "CVE-2025-55236 coverage Microsoft Windows Graphics Kernel TOCTOU vulnerability coverage 2025-09-2025-09-12"}

Observation: 
- Found coverage from the Microsoft Security Update Guide (MSRC) page itself (the primary source).
- Additional coverage sources (as examples) commonly include outlets such as BleepingComputer, The Hacker News, ZDNet, and TechRadar reporting on Windows vulnerabilities when Microsoft issues updates; specific article titles fluctuate by publication and date. For this task, the MSRC page remains the authoritative reference for details and remediation.
