Using the "access_combined" sourcetype makes sense for detecting cross-site scripting attempts due to its detailed log capabilities for web requests.

Here’s the Splunk SPL query that can help in detecting the indicators of compromise related to the threat:

```
sourcetype="access_combined" ("Marks.php" AND "Title") OR ("XSS payload" AND "Title") | stats count by uri_path, clientip, useragent
```

This query searches for logs from access_combined where requests to "Marks.php" include the "Title" argument or where XSS payloads are being detected. The results are aggregated by URI path, client IP, and user agent to identify potentially malicious activity.
