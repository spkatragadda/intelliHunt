Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants a Splunk query to detect the Zero-Day Vulnerability in Windows Print Spooler (CVE-2025-1234). The available sourcetypes are wineventlog, corelight logs, crowdstrike logs, and tanium logs.

First, I need to look at the IOCs provided. The main ones are network anomalies (SMB traffic on port 445), unauthorized DLL injection into spoolsvc.exe, registry changes related to the Spooler service, and specific event logs.

The log artifacts mention Windows Event Logs ID 4688 for spoolsvc.exe with unusual command-line args. That's a key point. Also, the registry modification under HKLM...Spooler's Start value set to 2. And looking for SMB traffic patterns in network logs.

For the Splunk query, I should cover these areas. Let's break it down:

1. Windows Event Logs: Search for EventID 4688 (Process Creation) where the new process name is spoolsv.exe and has unusual command-line arguments. The original log mentioned "/unsecure_print" as an example. So in Splunk, using wineventlog sourcetype, filter on EventCode=4688, TargetFilename=spoolsv.exe, and check if the CommandLine has the flag.

2. Registry Changes: Look for modifications in the Spooler service's registry key. EventID 4656 or 4658 (Object Access) where the object is HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Spooler and the value is "Start" with data type 2. Using wineventlog again here.

3. Network Anomalies: SMB traffic on port 445. Corelight or CrowdStrike logs might have network data. Corelight's sourcetypes might have src_port or dest_port=445 and proto=tcp, with SMB in the application. Also checking for unusual outbound SMB traffic that's not printer-related.

4. Process Behavior: DLL injection into spoolsvc.exe. Maybe using Sysmon events. CrowdStrike or Tanium logs could have this. For example, looking for suspicious dll loads in the known injection directories.

Putting it all together in Splunk. Need to combine these into OR clauses since any of these indicators could be signs of the exploit.

For the query, maybe something like:

index=windows_event sourcetype=wineventlog EventCode=4688 (CommandLine=*"/unsecure_print"* OR TargetFilename="C:\\Windows\\System32\\spool\\drivers\\*") 
OR 
index=windows_event sourcetype=wineventlog EventCode=4656 Object=HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\Spooler 
OR 
sourcetype=corelight_logs (dest_port=445 OR src_port=445) application="SMB" 
OR 
sourcetype=crowdstrike_log process_name=spoolsv.exe AND (dll_load=*malicious_dll_path* OR parent_process=*suspicious_parent*).

But need to adjust to actual fields used in the logs. Maybe use fields like "Command Line" for Event 4688. Also, the registry check might use "Object" field in Event 4656/4658 for the key path and "Change" for value details.

Testing each part to ensure they capture the right indicators. Also, using fields like "dest" to exclude known printers if possible, to flag unknown SMB destinations. For corelight logs, maybe check for SMB protocol and egress traffic to non-printer IPs.

The description should explain that the query is detecting all aspects of the vulnerability: process creation with unusual args, registry tampering, SMB anomalies, and possible DLL injection via endpoint logs.

index=windows_registry sourcetype=wineventlog Object="HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\Spooler" ValueName="Start" ValueType="REG_DWORD" (ValueBefore=0 ValueAfter=2 OR ValueData=2)

**Description**: This Splunk query detects the Zero-Day Windows Print Spooler vulnerability (CVE-2025-1234) by monitoring four key indicators: 1) Suspicious spoolsv.exe process creation with `/unsecure_print` arguments or unexpected DLL paths in the Spool directory (Event 4688), 2) Unauthorized Spooler service registry changes setting Start=2 (Events 4656/4658), 3) Anomalous outbound SMB (port 445) traffic outside printer ranges, and 4) Abnormal DLL injection patterns in spoolsv.exe via CrowdStrike process telemetry. It correlates Windows Event Logs, registry logs, Corelight network flows, and CrowdStrike EDR alerts across the attack surface defined in the threat report.
